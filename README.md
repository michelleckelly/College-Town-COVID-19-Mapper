# College-Town-COVID-19-Mapper

This is an R script that was written to pull county-level COVID-19 data (specifically for Houghton County and Marquette County, MI) and plot it with Michigan Tech (MTU; Houghton, MI) and Northern Marquette University (NMU; Marquette, MI) Fall 2020 semester start dates. Please feel free to fork, modify, etc. this script - it was written intially for personal use but I am sharing in case it is useful for others as well.
